_**Zarhus** is an embedded **Linux** distribution based on **Yocto**, developed
by 3mdeb. Zarhus simplified provisioning, integration and maintenance of
embedded platforms focused on strong security founded on immutable **Root of
Trust** and  leveraging the **Chain of Trust** up to the target application._

<!--

* If you watch this first time.
* By no mistake we want to focus on digital sovereignty.
* This is just introduction, we will talk more about our values, mission and
  vision later.

## Zarhus Developers Meetup

<br>

- Forum where Zarhus Team and Partners share knowledge and inform about
  Zarhus-related development.
- It would be quarterly event.
- Short presentations (<20min) focused on demo.
- Little time for questions (5min after each presentation).
- Recordings will be published on YouTube.
  - [ZDM#1](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuISieMwVBpLr1CMIGmm91ozBsYJaWEjr) are on YouTube.
  - You can get those also through [cfp.3mdeb.com](https://cfp.3mdeb.com/zarhus-developers-meetup-0x1-2025/talk/) and [ZDM#1 page](https://events.dasharo.com/event/4/zarhus-developers-meetup-1) since those are built-in our Pretalx instance.
  - OpenBMC from Mateusz was most viewed
  - Kicksecure's ram-wipe was second
  - Cache timing attacks was third

<!--

If no questions I will try to spin off some discussion and gather some ideas.

# How community can use it?

* Prerequisites:
  * At least basic Yocto understanding is required
  * Understanding of kas (setup tool for bitbake based projects) is recommended
* Keep checking progress on:
  - https://docs.zarhus.com/
  - https://github.com/zarhus
    - we create roadmap under `zarhus-issues` and will track our progress there
    - we will inform you during DUGs
* Currently most repositories are still in 3mdeb organization (32) in private gitlab (37)
  - https://github.com/3mdeb - search for `meta` keyword
  - most of the code is MIT-licensed
* In total it is 87k lines of code of 17k we already contributed upstream.
* Meanwhile for direct business needs we designed, developed and delivered over
  400k lines of code.
  - With Zarhus we want to change this proportions.

# Inevitable side-effect

* Multimedia, quality of life and UX features like fast logo display,
animations during boot-up or hardware video decoding, which are common in
consumer devices like Android phones require more work than usual.

- **Why?**  
  Our main priority is security and long-term maintainability over cosmetic or typical user features.  
  We use official, well-maintained software (upstream kernels, bootloaders, and security environments) instead of code provided by hardware vendors that might be less secure or harder to keep updated.

- **How does this cause the limitation?**  
  By not using vendor-specific short-cuts or binary blobs (which might enable early graphics), we don’t get early access to graphics hardware. This means users may see a basic boot process instead of a polished animation until Linux is running.

- **Can this be improved?**  
  Yes, but it would take major effort and cost—as it would require serious boot-time optimization and possibly some compromise on our core values for security and maintainability.

- **What’s next?**  
  We prefer focusing on our original agreement (static images, secure, maintainable system). If you need these extra features, we can discuss them as new projects or support packages in the future.
