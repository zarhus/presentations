<!--

"Zarhus: Trustworthy Embedded Linux Distro" is a Yocto-based embedded Linux
distribution that aims to simplify enabling advanced hardware security features
and performance in the embedded systems market. It extends U-Boot, ARM Trusted
Firmware, and Linux kernel to provide support for immutable hardware root of
trust, which propertise are preserved through a chain of trust to help provide
measured, verified, and secure boot. It also integrates secure storage, secure
elements, dTPM, and OP-TEE-based fTPM to support encrypted rootfs. The
distribution is currently focusing on Rockchip, NXP SoCs, and x86 architectures
and emphasizes its close collaboration with the Dasharo ecosystem for superior
testing and certification. This talk invites the community to explore Zarhus'
innovative features and contribute to its development.
